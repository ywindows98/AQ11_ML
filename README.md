# AQ11 machine learning algorithm in C#
This AQ11 implementation is currenly uses medical records dataset to classify cases and deside whether the stroke is possible. 
Output of the algorithm is formatted rule written in text and a positive full star that represents the rule for further usage by an algorithm or for classification.
** Algorithm implementation is universal for the categorical data **
Algorithm can be used on any possible versatile dataset that contains categorical data. It is possible to use it with numeric data also, but algorithm will read numeric values as attribute categories and will work with them accordingly. This can result in rule being inadequately large. So, it is not recommended to use it on numeric data.
